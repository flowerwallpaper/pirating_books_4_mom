If that doesn't work, just search "library genesis" and you'll find it
## Step 2: Find the book ## 
You can search by title, author, or ISBN. You will have to toggle the fiction/nonfiction thing or it might not show up. You can also browse books by topics but I wouldn't really recommend this, you're better off looking at goodreads or amazon or something to find what you want to read, and then searching it up here.

<br>
If you want to download your book into the Apple books app so you could read it there, you're gonna want to download an EPUB file. If you want to read it in browser on your computer or something, download as a PDF. You can filter the searches by download type or look at the "file" column <br>

## Step 3: Downloading ##
Click the title of the book, and it'll take you to a page like this. Then, you'll want to click one of these download things. It might say mirrors instead, it's like the same.  <br>

If you're on your computer, the download will pop up, and clicking it will automatically open it in books or in browser depending on if it's an EPUB or PDF.
